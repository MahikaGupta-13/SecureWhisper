SecureWhisper | Python (Django), AES Encryption, SQLite, Bootstrap
I developed SecureWhisper, a secure messaging platform that ensures end-to-end encrypted communication using AES encryption and user-managed keys, allowing only intended recipients to decrypt messages.
The system integrates secure user authentication, user discovery, and encrypted messaging within a responsive Django + Bootstrap interface. 
By prioritizing data privacy, encryption integrity, and scalable architecture, SecureWhisper addresses growing digital privacy concerns and offers a robust, user-friendly solution for confidential communication resistant to interception and unauthorized access.
